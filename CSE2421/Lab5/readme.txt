I certify that I completed all of the work myself with no aid from anyone aside from the instructor or the undergraduate graders.


Part 1:

Q1: Before you look back at your old code for reference. Pull up the code you wrote for Part 3.
Can you read and understand what it’s supposed to do?

I can read some what from the previous lab.

Q2: Based on your answer to Q1, do you think it’s important to have sufficiently readable code?
Why or why not?

Yes, because if I want this code again for some other task then I need to understand. Or if someone else wants this code then they will have to know whats going on.

Q3: Describe one key difference in the code that you had to write for Lab 2 vs the code you
wrote for this lab.

The key difference is that its long and harder to understand. Also, this code does not have the code that makes it harder to read.

Q4: Did you choose to create any functions to help with your encryption scheme? If yes, how
did you choose which registers to use for local storage? If no, explain why you chose to avoid
creating a helper function.

I did not use any helper function as it was not bad to do it in one file without any other function.

Q6: Answer this question honestly: does it feel more natural to manipulate bits in C (as you did
in Lab 2) or in Assembly (as you’re doing now)? Why?

It feels more natural to manipulate bits in c because of its syntax.


Part 2:

Q1: Try setting a breakpoint on main. Did it work? Why do you think that is?

Yes it worked. I think this is because it was also a tag.

Q2: Try setting a breakpoint in a slightly different way. Namely, type “break
[filename]:[linenumber]” where you replace the bracketed portions with the appropriate text.

I set up the breakpoint at encrypt in the code.

Q3: Next, type “tui reg general.” Describe what you see.

I saw three decided screens. One has information about all the registers, the other has the point at which we are in the code and the other window is for us to run commands.

Q4: On this screen, are you still able to step through the program line-by-line?

Yes.

Q5: Do the other commands for gdb still work while we’re on this screen?

Yes it works.
